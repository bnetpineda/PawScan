# Start New Chat Button Fix - TODO List

## Issues to Fix:
- [ ] Poor positioning - button stuck at bottom
- [ ] Always visible during search - creates layout conflicts
- [ ] Styling inconsistency - dark colors don't match app design
- [ ] Layout interference - appears over search results

## Implementation Plan:
- [ ] Add smart button positioning logic
- [ ] Hide button during search modal
- [ ] Use consistent styling with app design
- [ ] Add floating action button for existing conversations
- [ ] Add header button for empty state
- [ ] Test all scenarios (empty, with conversations, search active)
